# Foundations
## Project setup and creating a module
```shell
mkdir -p code/snippetbox
cd code/snippetbox
```

### Creating a module

- [Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules)

```shell
go mod init snippetbox.keer2345.go
```
```shell
cat go.mod
```
```go                                              
module snippetbox.keer2345.go

go 1.25.6
```

Setting up your project as a module has a number of advantages — including
making it much easier to manage third-party dependencies, avoid [supply-chain attacks](https://go.dev/blog/supply-chain),
and ensure reproducible builds of your application in the future.

### Hello world
```shell
➜  touch main.go
```
```go      
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
        fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```
```shell
➜  go run main.go 
Hello world!
```



### Additional information
#### Module paths for downloadable packages
If you’re creating a project which can be downloaded and used by other people and
programs, then it’s good practice for your module path to equal the location that the code
can be downloaded from.

For instance, if your package is hosted at `https://github.com/foo/bar` then the module
path for the project should be `github.com/foo/bar` .
