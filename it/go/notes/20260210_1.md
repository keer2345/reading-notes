# [A Beginner's Guide to Configuring Neovim for Go Programming](https://ikristina.github.io/blog/neovim-go-setup/)

## Go Tools you need to install first


Go (obviously). Check if it is installed by
```Bash
go version
```
Install delve: This is the standard debugger for Go and is essential for debugging support.
```Bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```
Install a Linter (Recommended): golangci-lint is a popular and powerful linter.
```Bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```
Ensure that your Go bin directory (usually $HOME/go/bin) is in your system’s PATH
