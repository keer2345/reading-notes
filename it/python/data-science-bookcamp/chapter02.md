This section covers:
- Creating simple plots using Matplotlib.
- Labeling plotted data.
- What is a probability distribution?
- Plotting and comparing multiple probability distributions.

**Python Matplotlib library**, which is fully optimized for outputting high-caliber plots and data visualizations.In this section, we will leverage Matplotlib to better comprehend the coin-flip probabilities that we computed in Section One.

# Basic Matplotlib Plots

Install *Matplotlib* library on our virtual environment:
```
pip install matplotlib
```

Importing Matplotlib
```python
from matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
