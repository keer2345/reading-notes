# [Do Things: A Clojure Crash Course](https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/)
## Syntax
### Forms
```clj
1
"a string"
["a" "vector" "of" "strings"]
```
```clj
(operator operand1 operand2 ... operandn)
```
```clj
(+ 1 2 3)
; => 6

(str "It was the panda " "in the library " "with a dust buster")
; => "It was the panda in the library with a dust buster"
```
### Control Flow
#### if
```clj
(if boolean-form
  then-form
  optional-else-form)
```

```clj
(if true
  "By Zeus's hammer!"
  "By Aquaman's trident!")
; => "By Zeus's hammer!"

(if false
  "By Zeus's hammer!"
  "By Aquaman's trident!")
; => "By Aquaman's trident!"

(if false
  "By Odin's Elbow!")
; => nil
```
#### do
```clj
(if true
  (do (println "Success!")
      "By Zeus's hammer!")
  (do (println "Failure!")
      "By Aquaman's trident!"))
; => Success!
; => "By Zeus's hammer!"
```

#### when
```clj
(when true
  (println "Success!")
  "abra cadabra")
; => Success!
; => "abra cadabra"
```
#### nil, true, false, Truthiness, Equality, and Boolean Expressions
Clojure has `true` and `false` values. `nil` is used to indicate *no value* in Clojure. You can check if a value is `nil` with the appropriately named `nil?` function:
```clj
(nil? 1)
; => false

(nil? nil)
; => true
```

Both `nil` and `false` are used to represent logical falsiness, whereas all other values are logically truthy. 
```clj
(if "bears eat beets"
  "bears beets Battlestar Galactica")
; => "bears beets Battlestar Galactica"

(if nil
  "This won't be the result because nil is falsey"
  "nil is falsey")
; => "nil is falsey"
```

Clojure’s equality operator is `=`:
```clj
(= 1 1)
; => true

(= nil nil)
; => true

(= 1 2)
; => false
```

Clojure uses the Boolean operators `or` and `and`. `or` returns either the first truthy value or the last value. `and` returns the first falsey value or, if no values are falsey, the last truthy values. 
```clj
(or false nil :large_I_mean_venti :why_cant_I_just_say_large)
; => :large_I_mean_venti

(or (= 0 1) (= "yes" "no"))
; => false

(or nil)
; => nil

(and :free_wifi :hot_coffee)
; => :hot_coffee

(and :feelin_super_cool nil false)
; => nil
```


### def

You use `def` to *bind* a name to a value in Clojure:
```clj
(def failed-protagonist-names
  ["Larry Potter" "Doreen the Explorer" "The Incredible Bulk"])

failed-protagonist-names
; => ["Larry Potter" "Doreen the Explorer" "The Incredible Bulk"]
```

For example, in Ruby:
```ruby
severity = :mild
error_message = "OH GOD! IT'S A DISASTER! WE'RE "
if severity == :mild
  error_message = error_message + "MILDLY INCONVENIENCED!"
else
  error_message = error_message + "DOOOOOOOMED!"
end
```
You might be tempted to do something similar in Clojure:
```clj
(def severity :mild)
(def error-message "OH GOD! IT'S A DISASTER! WE'RE ")
(if (= severity :mild)
  (def error-message (str error-message "MILDLY INCONVENIENCED!"))
  (def error-message (str error-message "DOOOOOOOMED!")))
```
```clj
(defn error-message
  [severity]
  (str "OH GOD! IT'S A DISASTER! WE'RE "
       (if (= severity :mild)
         "MILDLY INCONVENIENCED!"
         "DOOOOOOOMED!")))

(error-message :mild)
; => "OH GOD! IT'S A DISASTER! WE'RE MILDLY INCONVENIENCED!"
```

## Data Structures
All of Clojure’s data structures are immutable, meaning you can’t change them in place. For example, in Ruby you could do the following to reassign the failed protagonist name at index 0:
```ruby
failed_protagonist_names = [
  "Larry Potter",
  "Doreen the Explorer",
  "The Incredible Bulk"
]
failed_protagonist_names[0] = "Gary Potter"

failed_protagonist_names
# => [
#   "Gary Potter",
#   "Doreen the Explorer",
#   "The Incredible Bulk"
# ]
```

### Numbers
Here’s an integer, a float, and a ratio, respectively:
```clj
93
1.2
1/5
```
### Strings
```clj
"Lord Voldemort"
"\"He who must not be named\""
"\"Great cow of Moscow!\" - Hermes Conrad"

(def name "Chewbacca")
(str "\"Uggllglglglglglglglll\" - " name)
; => "Uggllglglglglglglglll" - Chewbacca
```
### Maps
```clj
{}

{:first-name "Charlie"
 :last-name "McFishwich"}

{"string-key" +}

{:name {:first "John" :middle "Jacob" :last "Jingleheimerschmidt"}}
```

> Notice that map values can be of any type—strings, numbers, maps, vectors, even functions. Clojure don’t care!

Besides using map literals, you can use the `hash-map` function to create a map:
```clj
(hash-map :a 1 :b 2)
; => {:a 1 :b 2}
```
You can look up values in maps with the `get` function:
```clj
(get {:a 0 :b 1} :b)
; => 1

(get {:a 0 :b {:c "ho hum"}} :b)
; => {:c "ho hum"}
```

`get` will return `nil` if it doesn’t find your key, or you can give it a default value to return, such as `"unicorns?"`:
```clj
(get {:a 0 :b 1} :c)
; => nil

(get {:a 0 :b 1} :c "unicorns?")
; => "unicorns?"
```

The `get-in` function lets you look up values in nested maps:
```clj
(get-in {:a 0 :b {:c "ho hum"}} [:b :c])
; => "ho hum"
```

Another way to look up a value in a map is to treat the map like a function with the key as its argument:
```clj
({:name "The Human Coffeepot"} :name)
; => "The Human Coffeepot"
```
### Keywords
```clj
:a
:rumplestiltsken
:34
:_?
 

(:a {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
; => 1
 

(get {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :a)
; => 1
 

(:d {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} "No gnome knows homes like Noah knows")
; => "No gnome knows homes like Noah knows"
```

### Vectors
```clj
[3 2 1]

(get [3 2 1] 0)
; => 3

(get ["a" {:name "Pugsley Winterbottom"} "c"] 1)
; => {:name "Pugsley Winterbottom"}

(vector "creepy" "full" "moon")
; => ["creepy" "full" "moon"]

 
(conj [1 2 3] 4)
; => [1 2 3 4]
```
### Lists
```clj
'(1 2 3 4)
; => (1 2 3 4)

(nth '(:a :b :c) 0)
; => :a

(nth '(:a :b :c) 2)
; => :c

(list 1 "two" {3 4})
; => (1 "two" {3 4})
(conj '(1 2 3) 4)
; => (4 1 2 3)
```


### Sets
```clj
#{"kurt vonnegut" 20 :icicle}

(hash-set 1 1 2 2)
; => #{1 2}

(conj #{:a :b} :b)
; => #{:a :b}

(set [3 3 3 4 4])
; => #{3 4}
```
```clj
(contains? #{:a :b} :a)
; => true

(contains? #{:a :b} 3)
; => false

(contains? #{nil} nil)
; => true

(:a #{:a :b})
; => :a

(get #{:a :b} :a)
; => :a

(get #{:a nil} nil)
; => nil

(get #{:a :b} "kurt vonnegut")
; => nil
```

## Functions

-    Calling functions
-    How functions differ from macros and special forms
-    Defining functions
-    Anonymous functions
-    Returning functions

###  Calling Functions
```clj
(+ 1 2 3 4)
(* 1 2 3 4)
(first [1 2 3 4])
```
```clj
(or + -)
; => #<core$_PLUS_ clojure.core$_PLUS_@76dace31>

((or + -) 1 2 3)
; => 6

((and (= 1 1) +) 1 2 3)
; => 6

((first [+ 0]) 1 2 3)
; => 6

(inc 1.1)
; => 2.1

(map inc [0 1 2 3])
; => (1 2 3 4)

(+ (inc 199) (/ 100 (- 7 2)))
(+ 200 (/ 100 (- 7 2))) ; evaluated "(inc 199)"
(+ 200 (/ 100 5)) ; evaluated (- 7 2)
(+ 200 20) ; evaluated (/ 100 5)
220 ; final evaluation

```
### Function Calls, Macro Calls, and Special Forms

### Defining Functions
```clj
(defn too-enthusiastic
   "Return a cheer that might be a bit too enthusiastic"
   [name]
   (str "OH. MY. GOD! " name " YOU ARE MOST DEFINITELY LIKE THE BEST "
  "MAN SLASH WOMAN EVER I LOVE YOU AND WE SHOULD RUN AWAY SOMEWHERE"))

(too-enthusiastic "Zelda")
; => "OH. MY. GOD! Zelda YOU ARE MOST DEFINITELY LIKE THE BEST MAN SLASH WOMAN EVER I LOVE YOU AND WE SHOULD RUN AWAY SOMEWHERE"
```
```clj
(defn no-params
  []
  "I take no parameters!")
(defn one-param
  [x]
  (str "I take one parameter: " x))
(defn two-params
  [x y]
  (str "Two parameters! That's nothing! Pah! I will smoosh them "
  "together to spite you! " x y))
```

Functions also support *rity overloading* This means that you can define a function so a different function body will run depending on the arity. Here’s the general form of a multiple-arity function definition. Notice that each arity definition is enclosed in parentheses and has an argument list:
```clj
(defn multi-arity
  ;; 3-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg third-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg third-arg))
  ;; 2-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg))
  ;; 1-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg]
     (do-things first-arg)))
     
(defn x-chop
  "Describe the kind of chop you're inflicting on someone"
  ([name chop-type]
     (str "I " chop-type " chop " name "! Take that!"))
  ([name]
     (x-chop name "karate"))) 
     
(x-chop "Kanye West" "slap")
; => "I slap chop Kanye West! Take that!"

(x-chop "Kanye East")
; => "I karate chop Kanye East! Take that!"

```

You can also make each arity do something completely unrelated:
```clj
(defn weird-arity
  ([]
     "Destiny dressed you this morning, my friend, and now Fear is
     trying to pull off your pants. If you give up, if you give in,
     you're gonna end up naked with Fear just standing there laughing
     at your dangling unmentionables! - the Tick")
  ([number]
     (inc number)))

```

```clj
(defn codger-communication
  [whippersnapper]
  (str "Get off my lawn, " whippersnapper "!!!"))

(defn codger
   [& whippersnappers]
  (map codger-communication whippersnappers))

(codger "Billy" "Anne-Marie" "The Incredible Bulk")
; => ("Get off my lawn, Billy!!!"
      "Get off my lawn, Anne-Marie!!!"
      "Get off my lawn, The Incredible Bulk!!!")
```
```clj
(defn favorite-things
  [name & things]
  (str "Hi, " name ", here are my favorite things: "
       (clojure.string/join ", " things)))

(favorite-things "Doreen" "gum" "shoes" "kara-te")
; => "Hi, Doreen, here are my favorite things: gum, shoes, kara-te"
```
