# Core Functions in Depth
## Programming to Abstractions
### Treating Lists, Vectors, Sets, and Maps as Sequences
```clj
(defn titleize
  [topic]
  (str topic " for the Brave and True"))

(map titleize ["Hamsters" "Ragnarok"])
; => ("Hamsters for the Brave and True" "Ragnarok for the Brave and True")

(map titleize '("Empathy" "Decorating"))
; => ("Empathy for the Brave and True" "Decorating for the Brave and True")

(map titleize #{"Elbows" "Soap Carving"})
; => ("Elbows for the Brave and True" "Soap Carving for the Brave and True")

(map #(titleize (second %)) {:uncomfortable-thing "Winking"})
; => ("Winking for the Brave and True")
```
### first, rest, and cons
- `first`
- `rest`
- `cons`
### Abstraction Through Indirection
```clj
(seq '(1 2 3))
; => (1 2 3)

(seq [1 2 3])
; => (1 2 3)

(seq #{1 2 3})
; => (1 2 3)

(seq {:name "Bill Compton" :occupation "Dead mopey guy"})
; => ([:name "Bill Compton"] [:occupation "Dead mopey guy"])
```
There are two notable details here. 
- First, `seq` always returns a value that looks and behaves like a list; you’d call this value a *sequence* or *seq*. 
- Second, the seq of a map consists of two-element key-value vectors.

You can convert the seq back into a map by using into to stick the result `into` an empty map (you’ll look at `into` closely later):
```clj
(into {} (seq {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}))
; => {:a 1, :c 3, :b 2}
```
