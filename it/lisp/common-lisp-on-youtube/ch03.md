**[Common Lisp Tutorial 3: Hangman](https://youtu.be/j1m1IUNVS7Q?list=PLCpux10P7KDKPb4eI5b_qSnQaY1ePGKGK)**

In this article you will learn how to build a simple hangman-style guessing game in common lisp

# Create Hangman Project

# Some knowledge
## Function FLET
**[FLET](https://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/flet.html)** is special form for local function binding. 
``` lisp
(flet ((sin2x (x) (sin (* 2 x)))
       (cos2x (x) (cos (* 2 x))))
 (+ (sin2x 0.2) (cos2x 0.2)))
=> 1.3104793
```
## Funcation MAPCAR
**[MAPCAR](https://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/mapcar.html)** applies function FN to elements of lists with same index. Each application result is put into resulting list. Length of resulting list is the length of the shortest list argument. See MAPCAN.
``` lisp
(mapcar (lambda (x) (+ x 10)) '(1 2 3 4)) => (11 12 13 14)
(mapcar #'round '(1.3 2.7 3.4 4.5)) => (1 3 3 4)
(mapcar #'list '(123 symbol "string" 345) '(1 2 3)) => ((123 1) (SYMBOL 2) ("string" 3))
(mapcar #'* '(3 4 5) '(4 5 6)) => (12 20 30)
``` 

## Function COERCE
**[COERCE](https://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/coerce.html)** function converts between different types. See full documentation for conversion description.
``` lisp
CL-USER> (coerce '(a b c) 'vector)
#(A B C)
CL-USER> (coerce #(a b c) 'list)
(A B C)
CL-USER> (coerce 4.4d0 'single-float)
4.4
CL-USER> (coerce 4.4s0 'double-float) 
4.400000095367432d0
CL-USER> (coerce "abc de_f__g 1 22" 'list)
(#\a #\b #\c #\  #\d #\e #\_ #\f #\_ #\_ #\g #\  #\1 #\  #\2 #\2)
``` 

## Function POSITION
**[POSITION](https://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/position.html) function searches for an element (item) satisfying the test. Return value is index of such item or NIL if item is not found. Index is relative to start of the sequence regardless of arguments. 
``` lisp
(position #\s "Some sequence") => 5
(position #\s "Some sequence" :key #'char-downcase) => 0
(position #\s "Some sequence" :key #'char-downcase :start 1) => 5
(position #\x "Some sequence") => NIL
(position '(1 2) #(9 3 (1 2) 6 7 8)) => NIL
(position '(1 2) #(9 3 (1 2) 6 7 8) :test #'equal) => 2
(position 1 #(0 1 0 0 0 1 0) :from-end t) => 5
```
