**[Common Lisp Tutorial 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://youtu.be/BRiS_enCbwA?list=PLCpux10P7KDKPb4eI5b_qSnQaY1ePGKGK)



A tutorial on building a simple rock paper scissors game in Common Lisp.

# Version 1
``` lisp
(defun game ()
  0)

#'game  ;; #<FUNCTION GAME>
```


``` lisp
(defun game ()
  (let* ((options '("rock" "paper" "scissors"))
         (cpu-choice
           (nth (random (length options) (make-random-state t)) options)))
    (format t "CPU choices: ~A~%" cpu-choice)
    ))
``` 
Run in REPL:
``` lisp 
CL-USER> (game)
CPU choices: scissors
NIL
``` 
# Version 2

``` lisp
(defpackage rock-paper-scissors
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :rock-paper-scissors)

(defun get-player-choice (options)
  (format t "Please enter either of these -> [ ~{~A~^, ~} ]:" options)
  (force-output)

  (let ((choice (string-downcase (read-line))))
    (if (member choice options :test #'equal)
        choice
        (get-player-choice options))))

(defun game ()
  (let* ((options '("rock" "paper" "scissors"))
         (cpu-choice
           (nth (random (length options) (make-random-state t)) options))
         (player-choice (get-player-choice options)))


    (cond
      ; When a draw has occured
      ((equal cpu-choice player-choice)
       (format t "You entered: ~A, CPU entered: ~A. It's a Draw!~%" player-choice cpu-choice))

      ; If user enter rock and cpu enter scissors
      ((and (equal player-choice "rock")
            (equal cpu-choice "scissors"))
       (format t "You entered: ~A, CPU entered: ~A. You Win!~%" player-choice cpu-choice))

      ; If user enter paper and cpu enter rock
      ((and (equal player-choice "paper")
            (equal cpu-choice "rock"))
       (format t "You entered: ~A, CPU entered: ~A. You Win!~%" player-choice cpu-choice))

      ; If user enter scissors and cpu enter paper
      ((and (equal player-choice "scissors")
            (equal cpu-choice "paper"))
       (format t "You entered: ~A, CPU entered: ~A. You Win!~%" player-choice cpu-choice))

       (t (format t "You entered: ~A, CPU entered: ~A. You loose!~%" player-choice cpu-choice)))))

(game)
```
Run `(game)` in REPL:
``` lisp
CL-USER> (game)
Please enter either of these -> [ rock, paper, scissors ]:paper
You entered: rock, CPU entered: paper. You loose!
NIL
```


**`eq` and `equal`  :**

``` lisp
CL-USER> (eq "a" "a")
NIL
CL-USER> (equal "a" "a")
T
```
``` lisp
(member "a" '("a" "b"))
NIL
CL-USER>  (member "a" '("a" "b") :test #'eq)
NIL
CL-USER>  (member "a" '("a" "b") :test #'equal)
("a" "b")
```

# Run  App in Terminal:
```
~ sbcl --script ~/.quicklisp/local-projects/rock-paper-scissors/src/main.lisp
Please enter either of these -> [ rock, paper, scissors ]:rock
You entered: rock, CPU entered: paper. You loose!

~ sbcl --script ~/.quicklisp/local-projects/rock-paper-scissors/src/main.lisp
Please enter either of these -> [ rock, paper, scissors ]:paper
You entered: paper, CPU entered: rock. You Win!
