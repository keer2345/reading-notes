# Ch01 Getting started with Lisp
## Lisp Dialects
### A Tale of Two Lisps
- ANSI Common Lisp
- Scheme

ANSI Common Lisp is the best language for
you! ANSI Common Lisp traces its ancestry most directly from the ancient
Lisp dialects, built on top of millions of programmer hours, giving it incredibly
rich functionality. Sure, it has some baroque function names due to countless
historical accidents, but this Lisp can really fly in the right hacker’s hands.

### Up-and-coming Lisps
One new Lisp that is showing promise is Clojure, Clojure is build on the Java Platform, allowing 
it to leverage a lot of mature Java libraries right out of the box.

### Lisp Dialects  Used for Scripting

Some Lisp dialects are used for scripting, including these:

- Emacs Lisp is used for scripting inside the popular (and overall awesome) Emacs text editor.
- Guile Scheme is used as a scripting language in several open source applications.
- Script-Fu Scheme is used with the GIMP image editor.
