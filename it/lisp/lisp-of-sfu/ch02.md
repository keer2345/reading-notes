# [LISP Tutorial 2: Advanced Functional Programming in LISP](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/310/pwfong/Lisp/2/tutorial2.html)

We define the _reversal_ of a list L to be a list containing exactly the elements of _L_ in reversed order. The Common LISP built-in function `(reverse L)` returns the reversal of _L_:

```lisp
CL-USER>  (reverse '(1 2 3 4))
(4 3 2 1)
CL-USER>  (reverse '(1 (a b) (c d) 4))
(4 (C D) (A B) 1)
CL-USER>  (reverse nil)
NIL
```

```lisp
(defun my-list-reverse (L)
  (if (null L)
      L
      (append (my-list-reverse (rest L))
              (list (first L)))))
```

## Factorial Revisited

To better understand how auxiliary functions and accumulator variables are used, let us revisit the problem of computing factorials. The following is an alternative implementation of the factorial function:

```lisp
(defun fast-factorial (N)
  (fast-factorial-aux N 1))

(defun fast-factorial-aux (N A)
  (if (= N 1)
      A
      (fast-factorial-aux (1- N) (* N A))))
```

## Tail Recursions

**Exercise**: Recall that the N'th triangular number is defined to be _1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N_. Give a tail-recursive implementation of the function `(fast-triangular N)` which returns the N'th triangular number.

```lisp
(defun fast-triangular (N)
  (fast-triangular-aux N 1))

(defun fast-triangular-aux (N A)
  (if (= N 1)
      A
      (fast-factorial-aux (1- N) (+ N A))))
```

**Exercise**: Give a tail-recursive implementation of the function `(fast-power B E)` that raises B to the power E (assuming that both B and E are non-negative integers).

```lisp
(defun fast-power-aux (B E A)
  (if (zerop E)
      A
      (fast-power-aux B (1- E) (* B A))))
```

**Exercise**: Give a tail-recursive implementation of the function `(fast-list-length L)`, which returns the length of a given list L.

```lisp
(defun fast-list-length-aux (L A)
  (if (null L)
      A
      (fast-list-length-aux (rest L) (1+ A))))
```

## Functions as First-Class Objects

A data type is first-class in a programming language when you can pass instances of the data type as function arguments or return them as function values. We are used to treating numeric and Boolean values as first-class data types in languages like Pascal and C. However, we might not be familiar to the notion that functions could be treated as first-class objects, that is, functions can be passed as function arguments and returned as function values. This unique feature of Common LISP and other functional languages makes it easy to build very powerful abstractions. In the remaining of this tutorial, we will look at what passing functional arguments buys us. In the fourth tutorial, when we talk about imperative programming in LISP, we will return to the topic of returning functional values.

Frequently, we need to apply a transformation multiple times on the same data object. For example, we could define the following transformation:

```lisp
(defun double (x)
  "Multiple X by 2."
  (* 2 x))
```

We could compute 2^4 by applying the double transformation 4 times on 1:

```lisp
CL-USER> (double (double (double (double 1))))
```

```lisp
(defun repeat-transformation (F N X)
  "Repeat applying function F on object X for N times."
  (if (zerop N)
      X
    (repeat-transformation F (1- N) (funcall F X))))
```

```lisp
CL-USER> (repeat-transformation (function double) 4 1)
```

## Higher-Order Functions

```lisp
USER(30): (defun prepend-blah (L) (cons 'blah L))
PREPEND-BLAH
USER(31): (repeat-transformation (function prepend-blah) 10 nil)
(BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH)

USER(32): (first (repeat-transformation (function rest) 6 '(a b c d e f g h i j)))
G
```

```lisp
(defun list-nth (N L)
  (first (repeat-transformation (function rest) N L)))
```

One last point before we move on. The closure constructor function is used very often when working with higher-order functions. Common LISP therefore provide another equivalent syntax to reduce typing. When we want Common LISP to interpret a name F as a function, instead of typing (function F), we can also type the shorthand #'F. The prefix #' is nothing but an alternative syntax for the closure constructor. For example, we could enter the following:

```lisp
USER(33): (repeat-transformation #'double 4 1)
16
USER(34): (repeat-transformation #'prepend-blah 10 nil)
(BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH)
USER(35): (first (repeat-transformation #'rest 6 '(a b c d e f g h i j)))
G

```

## Lambda Expressions

Some of the functions, like prepend-blah for example, serves no other purpose but to instantiate the generic algorithm repeat-transformation. It would be tedious if we need to define it as a global function using defun before we pass it into repeat-transformation. Fortunately, LISP provides a mechanism to help us define functions "in place":

```lisp
USER(36): (repeat-transformation #'(lambda (L) (cons 'blah L)) 10 nil)
(BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH)

USER(36): (repeat-transformation #'(lambda (x) (* 2 x)) 4 1)
16
```

**Exercise**: Define a function `(apply-func-list L X)` so that, given a list L of functions and an object X, apply-func-list applies the functions in L to X in reversed order. For example, the following expression

```lisp
(defun apply-func-list (L X)
  (if (null L)
      X
      (funcall (first L) (apply-func-list (rest L) X))))
```

**Exercise**: Use apply-func-list to compute the following:

1. 10 times the fourth element of the list (10 20 30 40 50),
1. the third element of the second element in the list ((1 2) (3 4 5) (6)),
1. the difference between 10 and the length of (a b c d e f),
1. a list containing a list containing the symbol blah.

```lisp
;; 10 times the fourth element of the list (10 20 30 40 50)
(apply-func-list (list #'(lambda (N) (* 10 N)) #'fourth) '(10 20 30 40 50))

;; the third element of the second element in the list
;; ((1 2) (3 4 5) (6))
(apply-func-list (list #'third #'second) '((1 2) (3 4 5) (6)))

;; the difference between 10 and the length of (a b c d e f)
(apply-func-list (list #'(lambda (N) (- 10 N)) #'list-length) '(a b c d e f))

;; a list containing a list containing the symbol 'blah
(apply-func-list (list #'list #'list) 'blah)
```
