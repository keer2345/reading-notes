# [Learning Lisp for CMPT 310](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/310/pwfong/Lisp/)

## Tutorial Notes

All the Lisp that you need for completing the programming assignments will be presented in the following tutorial notes. You are expected to master the materials of one tutorial in a week. Work through the exercises. They are good for your soul.

1. [Basic LISP Programming](ch01.md) Basic Lisp data types, some built-in functions, defining functions, loading and compiling programs, recursions (linear, multiple, structural).
1. [Advanced Functional Programming in LISP](ch02.md) Tail recursions, higher-order functions, multiple values.
1. [Basic LISP Programming](ch03.md) Recursive data types (constructors, recognizers, selectors), structural recursions, abstract data types, larger examples.
1. [Basic LISP Programming](ch04.md) Variables, destructive operations, sequencing, function closures, looping constructs.
