# Chapter 3 - [Essential Lisp in Twelve Lessons](https://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/MTP/Common/David-Lamkins/chapter03.html)

## Lissen 1 - Essential Syntax

- Lists are surrounded by parentheses
- Atoms are separated by whitespace or parentheses Now that you can recognize a list, you'd like to have a name for the things that appear between the parentheses -- the things that are not themselves lists, but rather (in our examples so far) words and numbers. These things are called atoms.

## Lesson 2 - Essential Evaluation
- A form is meant to be evaluated
- A function is applied to its arguments
- A function can return any number of values
- Arguments are usually not modified by a function
- Arguments are usually evaluated before function application
- Arguments are evaluated in left-to-right order
- Special forms and macros change argument evaluation

## Lesson 3 - Some Examples of Special Forms and Macros
**SETQ**

``` common-lisp
? (setq my-name "David")
-> "David"

? my-name
-> "David"

? (setq a-variable 57)
-> 57

? a-variable
-> 57

? (setq a-variable :a-keyword)
-> :A-KEYWORD
```


**LET**

``` common-lisp
? (let ((a 3)
        (b 4)
        (c 5))
    (* (+ a b) c))
-> 35
```

**COND**

``` common-lisp
? (let ((a 1)
        (b 2)
        (c 1)
        (d 1))
    (cond ((eql a b) 1)
          ((eql a c) "First form" 2)
          ((eql a d) 3)))
-> 2
```

**QUOTE**

``` common-lisp
? (setq a 97)
-> 97

? a
-> 97

? (setq b 23)
-> 23

? (setq a b)
-> 23

? a
-> 23

? (setq a (quote b))
-> B

? a
-> B
```


## Lesson 4 - Putting things together, and taking them apart
**CONS**

``` common-lisp
? (cons 1 nil)
-> (1)

? (cons 2 (cons 1 nil))
-> (2 1)

? (cons 3 (cons 2 (cons 1 nil)))
-> (3 2 1)

? (cons 1 ())
-> (1)

? (cons 2 (cons 1 ()))
-> (2 1)

? (cons 3 (cons 2 (cons 1 ())))
-> (3 2 1)
```

**LIST**

``` common-lisp
? (list 1 2 3)
-> (1 2 3)

? (list 1 2 :hello "there" 3)
-> (1 2 :HELLO "there" 3)

? (let ((a :this)
        (b :and)
        (c :that))
     (list a 1 b c 2))
-> (:THIS 1 :AND :THAT 2)
```

**FIRST and REST**

``` common-lisp
? (setq my-list (quote (1 2 3 4 5)))
-> (1 2 3 4 5)

? (first my-list)
-> 1

? (rest my-list)
-> (2 3 4 5)

? (first (rest my-list))
-> 2

? (rest (rest my-list))
-> (3 4 5)

? (first (rest (rest my-list)))
-> 3

? (rest (rest (rest my-list)))
-> (4 5)

? (first (rest (rest (rest my-list))))
-> 4
```

## Lesson 5 - Naming and Identity
**A symbol is just a name**

``` common-lisp
(father John Barry)
(son John Harold)
(father John Susan)
(mother Edith Barry)
(mother Edith Susan)
```

**A symbol is always unique**

``` common-lisp
? (eq 'a 'a)
-> T

? (eq 'david 'a)
-> NIL

? (eq 'David 'DAVID)
-> T

? (setq zzz 'sleeper)
-> SLEEPER

? (eq zzz 'sleeper)
-> T
```

**A symbol can name a value**

``` common-lisp

``` common-lisp
? (setq first 'number-one)
-> NUMBER-ONE

? (first (list 3 2 1))
-> 3

? first
-> NUMBER-ONE
```


## A value can have more than one name

``` common-lisp
? (setq L1 (list 'a 'b 'c))
-> (A B C)

? (setq L2 L1)
-> (A B C)

? (eq L1 L2)
-> T

? (setq L3 (list 'a 'b 'c))
-> (A B C)

? (eq L3 L1)
-> NIL
```
