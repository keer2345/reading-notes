# What’s Scalatra good at?

Mobile app development on Android and iOS has exploded over the past half decade. At the same time, single-page in-browser development frameworks such as **Backbone.js**, **Ember.js**, and **AngularJS** are rapidly gaining in popularity.

**Scalatra** is a perfect fit for these clients. It’s easy to install, lightweight, and fast. It lets you design and build out high-performance web APIs quickly, and it’s integrated with special tools to produce beautiful, functional, and correct API documentation.

# Hello World

Scalatra is simple. All you need to do is add a small configuration file and download and run one command, and you have a running web application. The following listing illustrates just how simple a Scalatra program can be.

```scala
package com.example.yourapp
import org.scalatra._

class HelloWorld extends ScalatraServlet {
  get("/") {
    "Hello world"
  }
}
```

# Microframeworks vs. full-stack frameworks

# How does Scalatra compare with other Scala web frameworks?

Scalatra VS **lift** or **play**

- Scalatra is a lean MVC framework
- Scalatra runs on servlets

## Other Scala web frameworks
- [play](https://www.playframework.com/)
- [skinny](http://skinny-framework.org/)
- [finatra](https://github.com/twitter/finatra)
- [lift](https://www.liftweb.net/)



# Install Scalatra

- Generating a new project
- Downloading dependencies and building the app
- Starting the Hello World application

See details on [scalatra/scalatra.g8](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra.g8)

```sh
$ sbt new scalatra/scalatra.g8
$ cd <name-of-app>
$ sbt
> jetty:start
```

Or, Automatic code reloading:
```sh
$ sbt
> ~;jetty:stop;jetty:start
```

`cat src/main/scala/com/example/app/MyScalatraServlet.scala`:

```scala
package com.example.app

import org.scalatra._

class MyScalatraServlet extends ScalatraServlet {

  get("/") {
    views.html.hello()
  }

}
```

**Making changes and seeing them in your browser:**

```scala
get("/") {
  "Hello world"
}
```

**Finally, let’s change the URL matcher. Change to this:**

```scala
get("/hello") {
  "Hello world!"
}
```

Visit it in your browser, at http://localhost:8080/hello . You’re done!
