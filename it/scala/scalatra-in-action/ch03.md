This chapter covers:

- Defining a route
- Chosing the right HTTP method
- Matching path expressions
- Exploring advanced routes

Scalatra often serves applications unrelated to web clients. It’s used for RESTful services that may serve a mobile application or integrate internal systems.

# Anatomy of a route

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/03fig01.jpg)

A Scalatra route is composed of three main components:

- The HTTP method
- The route matcher
- The action

# Choosing the right method

## The CRUD mthods

| CRUD operation | HTTP method |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Create         | POST, PUT   |
| Read           | GET         |
| Update         | PUT, PATCH  |
| Delete         | DELETE      |

### Get

```scala
class RecordStore extends ScalatraServlet {
  get("/artists/:name/info") {
    Artist.find(params("name")) match {
      case Some(artist) => artist.toXml
      case None => status = 404
    }
  }
}
```

Use `GET` in the following situations:

- When you’re implementing a read-only operation, such as the R in CRUD.
- When the request can be submitted repeatedly.
- When the response should be bookmarkable or indexed in search engines.

### Post

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/031fig01_alt.jpg)

Use POST in the following cases:

- When implementing create operations, such as the C in CRUD.
- When the server is responsible for generating a URI for the created entity.
- When you’re implementing a write operation, and nothing else seems to fit.

### Put

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/032fig01_alt.jpg)

Use PUT in the following cases:

- When implementing update operations, such as the U in CRUD
- When implementing create operations, such as the C in CRUD when the URI is known.

### Delete

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/033fig01_alt.jpg)

Use DELETE in the following case:

- When implementing delete operations, such as the D in CRUD

## The lesser-known methods

### Head

A `HEAD` request should be handled like an otherwise identical `GET` request, except that it shouldn’t return a body. The following listing declares special handling for a `HEAD` request to an artist.

```scala
class RecordStore extends ScalatraServlet {
  head("/artists/:name/info") {
    contentType = "text/json"
    if (Artist.exists(params("name"))) Ok()
    else NotFound()
  }
}
```

Use HEAD in this case:

- When the default implementation is suboptimal

### Options

An `OPTIONS` request, like `HEAD`, is implemented in terms of other methods. It’s expected to return an `Allows` header so clients understand which other methods are supported for a particular path.

The following listing shows that a call to delete Frank Zappa will not be supported by the `delete` call.

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/035fig01_alt.jpg)

Use `OPTIONS` in these cases:

- When the default implementation is incorrect
- For security

## Overriding the methods

# Route matchers

Three types of route matchers are supported out of the box:

- Path expressions (string)
- Regular expressions
- Boolean expressions

## Path expressions

### Static path expressions

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/039fig01_alt.jpg)

```scala
class RecordStore extends ScalatraServlet {
  get("/artists/Bruce_Springsteen/info") {
    showArtist("Bruce Springsteen")
  }

  get("/artists/Charles_Mingus/info") {
    showArtist("Charles Mingus")
  }

  get("/artists/A_Tribe_Called_Quest/info") {
    showArtist("A Tribe Called Quest")
  }

  def showArtist(name: String) = {
    Artist.find(name) match {
      case Some(artist) => artist.toXml
      case None => NotFound()
    }
  }
}
```

### Path parameters

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/040fig01_alt.jpg)

### Optional parameters

```scala
class RecordStore extends ScalatraServlet {
  get("/artists/?") {
    <artists>${Artist.fetchAll().map(_.toXml)}</artists>
  }
}
```

The `/artists/?` expression would match a request to both of these:

- http://localhost:8080/artists
- http://localhost:8080/artists/

**Optional format suffix:**
![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/041fig01_alt.jpg)

**Format examples:**

| URI                                                  | Format param |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| http://localhost:8080/artists/Otis_Redding/info      | undefined    |
| http://localhost:8080/artists/Otis_Redding/info.json | "json"       |
| http://localhost:8080/artists/Otis_Redding/info.xml  | "xml"        |
| http://localhost:8080/artists/Otis_Redding/info.     | undefined    |
| http://localhost:8080/artists/Otis_Redding/infojson  | "json"       |

### Splat support

Path expressions also support **splat** parameters. Splat parameters are nicknamed for the `*` character that declares them.

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/042fig01_alt.jpg)

## Regular expressions

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/043fig01_alt.jpg)

## Boolean expressions

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/045fig01_alt.jpg)

```scala
get("/listen/*".r) {
  if (isMobile(request.getHeader("User-Agent"))) {
    StreamService.mobile(params("splat"))
  } else {
    StreamService.desktop(params("splat"))
  }
}
```

# Advanced route matching

## Conflict resolution

What happens when a request matches two routes? Scalatra looks for matching routes from the bottom of your application, and works its way to the top.

Tracing a request for `The_Rolling_Stones`:
![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/03fig02_alt.jpg)

When a request comes in for `/artists/The_Rolling_Stones/info`, the top and bottom routes match. Because Scalatra routes from the bottom up, `/artists/The_:name/*` is matched. This triggers the redirect response. The client immediately requests `/artists/Rolling_Stones/info`. Scalatra, as always, matches the request from the bottom up (Redirects are stateless. Scalatra neither knows nor cares that the original request was rewritten). The redirected request finally matches `/artists/:name/info`, which generates the desired response.

## Rails-style path expressions

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/carrero2/Figures/048fig01_alt.jpg)

**Rails-style format examples:**

| URI                             | Sinatra /artists/:name/info.?:format? | Rails /artists/:name/info(.:format) |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| /artists/Otis_Redding/info      | Yes                                   | Yes                                 |
| /artists/Otis_Redding/info.json | Yes                                   | Yes                                 |
| /artists/Otis_Redding/info.xml  | Yes                                   | Yes                                 |
| /artists/Otis_Redding/info.     | Yes                                   | No                                  |
| /artists/Otis_Redding/infojson  | Yes                                   | No                                  |

# Summary

- Choosing the correct HTTP methods results in APIs that act in accordance with prevailing standards.
- It’s important to choose intuitive URIs for application resources. You can use Scalatra’s route resolution to create concise code.
