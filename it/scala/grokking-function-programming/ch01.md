# Perhaps you picked up this book because

- You are curious about functional programming
- You tried to learn functional programming before
- For you, the jury is still out
- Or maybe something else?

# What do you need to know before we start?

You will follow along comfortably if:

- you are familiar with basic object orientation concepts like classes and objects,
- you are able to read and comprehend code like this one:

```java
class Book {
     private String title;
     private List<Author> authors;

     public Book(String title) {
       this.title = title;
       this.authors = new ArrayList<Author>();
     }


     public void addAuthor(Author author) {
       this.authors.add(author);
     }
   }
```

You will get maximum benefits if:

- you have had problems with stability, testability or regression or integration of your software modules,
- you have experienced problems debugging code like this one:

```java
public void makeSoup(List<String> ingredients)  {
     if(ingredients.contains(“water”)) {
       add(“water”)
     } else throw new NotEnoughIngredientsException();
     heatUpUntilBoiling();
     addVegetablesUsing(ingredients);
     waitMinutes(20);
   }
```

You don’t need to...

- be an expert in object orientation,
- be a Java master,
- know anything about any functional programming language such as Kotlin, Scala, F#, Clojure or Haskell.

# What do functions look like?

Here is a bunch of different functions. All of them have something in common: they get some values as an input, do something, and maybe return a value as an output. Let’s see:

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
public static char getFirstCharacter(String s) {
  return s.charAt(0);
}
public static int divide(int a, int b) {
  return a / b;
}
public static void eatSoup(Soup soup) {
  // TODO: “eating the soup” algorithm
}
```

**Why all the public statics?**

You probably wonder about the public static modifier in each definition. Well, it’s there on purpose. Functions we use in this book are all static, i.e. they don’t need any object instance to be executed. They are free—they can be called by anybody from anywhere, as long as the caller has the input parameters they require. They work only with the data the caller provides, nothing more.

```java
public static int increment(int x) {
  // TODO
}
public static String concatenate(String a, String b) {
  // TODO
}
```

# Meet the function

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

# When the code lies...

Some of the most difficult problems programmer encounters happen when the code does something it’s not supposed to do. These problems are often connected to the signature telling different story than the body. To see this in action, let’s briefly revisit the four functions we’ve seen earlier.

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

```java
public static char getFirstCharacter(String s) {
  return s.charAt(0);
}
```

```java
public static int divide(int a, int b) {
  return a / b;
}
```

```java
public static void eatSoup(Soup soup) {
  // TODO: “eating the soup” algorithm
}
```

getFirstCharacter promises that when we provide a String, it will give us a char in return. However, sneaky as we are, when we provide an empty String, it will not give us any char, it will throw an exception!

divide will not provide a promised int if we give it 0 as b.

eatSoup promises to eat the soup we provide, but when we do, it does nothing and returns void. This is probably what most children have as default implementation.

add, on the other hand, will return an int, no matter what we provide as a and b—as promised! We can count on such functions!
